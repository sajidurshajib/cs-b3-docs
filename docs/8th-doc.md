**FootPrinting**

There are two types of footprinting in ethical hacking:

1. active footprinting
2. passive footprinting

What is active footprinting?

Active footprinting describes the process of using tools and techniques, like using the traceroute commands or a ping sweep -- Internet Control Message Protocol sweep -- to collect data about a specific target. This often triggers the target's intrusion detection system (IDS). It takes a certain level of stealth and creativity to evade detection successfully.

What is passive footprinting?

As the name implies, passive footprinting involves collecting data about a specific target using innocuous methods, like performing a Google search, looking through Archive.org, using NeoTrace, browsing through employees' social media profiles, looking at job sites and using Whois, a website that provides the domain names and associated networks fora specific organization. It is a stealthier approach to footprinting because it does not trigger the target's IDS.

**WhoIS**

Domain information provider. [Link 1]

**CRT**

Enter an Identity (Domain Name, Organization Name, etc),
a Certificate Fingerprint (SHA-1 or SHA-256) or a crt.sh ID. [Link 2]

**Hunter.IO**

The Domain Search provides a list of the people working in a company with their name and email address, all found on the web. With 100+ million email addresses indexed, effective search filters and deliverability checks, it's Hunter's most powerful email-finding tool. [Link 3]
