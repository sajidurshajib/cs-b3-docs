* According to Assets category Severity Level documentation will be written. **Assets Level** - Platinum, Gold, Silver (Remember asset is a person here but asset could be anything)
* Risk mitigate - When take protective measure is called risk mitigate. (strong password policy, firewall, anti-virus, wifi protection,os update/ patch update)

* APT Attack: An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a prolonged and targeted cyber attack in which an intruder gains access to a network and remains undetected for an extended period of time.
APT attacks are initiated to steal data rather than cause damage to the target organization's network.[1]
