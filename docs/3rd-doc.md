**Hashing**

Hashing is the practice of using an algorithm to map data of any size to a fixed length. This is called a hash value (or sometimes hash code or hash sums or even a hash digest if you’re feeling fancy). Whereas encryption is a two-way function, hashing is a one-way function. While it’s technically possible to reverse-hash something, the computing power required makes it unfeasible. Hashing is one-way.[1]


**4 Elements of  Security**

1. Confidentiality
2. Integrity
3. Availability
4. Authentication


**Ethical Hacker terminalogy**

* Threat - Lead to a ptential breach of security.
* Exploit - Script or software that can take advantages of a bug.
* Vulnerability - Error or bug that can create security risk.
* Target of Evaulation (TOE) - The subject of a security analysis or attack.
* Remote - Attack without prior access.
* Local,- Need prior access.
* Attack - Attack occurs when system compromised. 


**Common method of Hacking**

* Virus/Trojan - A virus within something.
* Phishing - Replicate logine section.
* Eavesdropping - Monitoring without you knowing.
* Fake wap - Fake wifi to get password.
* DDoSing (Denial of Service) - Flooding traffic to crush your site.   
* Keylogger - That tracks your keypad.
* Social Engineering - Psychological manipulation.
* Bait and Switch - Fake ads with virus.
