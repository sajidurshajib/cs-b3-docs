**OSINT framework**

OSINT, as we explained in our previous article 'What is OSINT?', stands for Open Source Intelligence. And in the same way that military intelligence teams play a critical role in gaining advantage over the enemy, OSINT plays a critical role in the field of cybersecurity.


**Security Header**

There are services out there that will analyse the HTTP response headers of other sites but I also wanted to add a rating system to the results. The HTTP response headers that this site analyses provide huge levels of protection and it's important that sites deploy them. Hopefully, by providing an easy mechanism to assess them, and further information on how to deploy missing headers, we can drive up the usage of security based headers across the web.[Link 3]
